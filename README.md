## üåê Network Design Overview

### Devices Used:
- 1 √ó Router (2911)
- 1 √ó Multilayer Switch (3560-24PS)
- 6 √ó PCs (representing Smart Devices, Security Devices, Personal Devices, Admin)

### VLANs Configured:
| VLAN ID | Name        | Devices                  |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 10      | IoT         | Smart_Light, Thermostat  |
| 20      | Security    | CCTV_Camera              |
| 30      | Personal    | Laptop, Mobile           |
| 99      | Management  | Admin_PC                 |

### IP Schema:
| VLAN | Gateway IP     | Device IPs               |
|------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 10   | 192.168.10.1   | 192.168.10.10-11         |
| 20   | 192.168.20.1   | 192.168.20.10            |
| 30   | 192.168.30.1   | 192.168.30.10-11         |
| 99   | 192.168.99.1   | 192.168.99.10            |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Highlights

- VLANs created and assigned to specific interfaces on the switch.
- Inter-VLAN routing enabled using `ip routing` on the multilayer switch.
- Static IPs assigned to all PCs to simulate real device segregation.

## üß™ How to Use

1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Review the VLAN assignments and IP configurations.
3. Ping across devices in the same and different VLANs.
4. (Optional) Extend the network with DHCP, ACLs, or wireless devices.
